\# 📊 HR Data Analysis \& Visualization Project



\## Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset containing over \*\*22,000 rows\*\* of Human Resources data ranging from the year \*\*2000 to 2020\*\*. The primary goal is to uncover insights regarding employee demographics, turnover trends, gender distribution, and tenure using SQL for data processing and PowerBI for visualization.



\## 🛠 Tools Used

\* \*\*Data Cleaning \& Analysis:\*\* MySQL

\* \*\*Data Visualization:\*\* PowerBI

\* \*\*Source Data:\*\* HR Dataset (2000 - 2020)



\## 🧹 Data Cleaning \& Limitations

Before analysis, a thorough data cleaning process was conducted to ensure accuracy:

\* \*\*Age Validation:\*\* 967 records with negative ages were excluded. Only employees aged 18 and above were included.

\* \*\*Term Date Validation:\*\* 1,599 records with termination dates far into the future were excluded. Only termination dates less than or equal to the current date were used.

The analysis focused on answering the following critical business questions:

1\.  What is the gender breakdown of employees in the company?

2\.  What is the race/ethnicity breakdown of employees?

3\.  What is the age distribution of employees?

4\.  How many employees work at headquarters versus remote locations?
